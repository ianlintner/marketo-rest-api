# marketo-rest-api
Node.js REST API 

The goal of this project is to fully implement the Marketo REST API in node.js using node-rest-client to build a
REST API npm module.

Currently this is under active development and is not ready for prime time. If you like what you see let me know if you want to contribute, test or help. This is only about 10% complete at this time.

The roadmap for this project is as follows:
* Implement the full REST API (http://developers.marketo.com/documentation/rest/)
* Create a test suite to unit test the Marketo API using some sort of mock service.
* Create functional tests.
* Implement a synchronus version of the module (may not be in the cards)
*
